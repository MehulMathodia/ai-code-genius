# 🚀 AI Code Genius Pro
### *Deep-Logic Refactoring & Algorithmic Intelligence Dashboard*

AI Code Genius Pro is a dedicated development tool designed to bridge the gap between "writing code" and "architecting code." Built with **React 19**, **FastAPI**, and **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, it performs **Deep-Logic Refactoring**—identifying structural bottlenecks and transforming them into production-ready, optimized logic.

## 💡 Why This Project?
Standard AI chatbots often provide conversational, unstructured code. I built this tool to provide **structured, actionable engineering insights** in a single click, specifically targeting algorithmic efficiency for C++ and Python developers.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Deep-Logic Refactoring:** Automatically converts exponential $O(2^n)$ logic into $O(n)$ iterative solutions.
- **Complexity Engine:** Instant Big O analysis for Time and Space complexity.
- **Cross-Language Translation:** High-fidelity logic migration between C++ and Python.
- **Modern Developer UX:** Minimalist dashboard with a tabbed interface for comparative analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 19 (Hooks, Axios), Tailwind CSS v4 (Zero-Config), Monaco Editor.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Async processing), Pydantic (Data validation), Python-Dotenv.
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (optimized for low-latency coding tasks).
